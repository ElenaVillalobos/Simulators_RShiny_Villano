# Simulators RShiny #
by Elena Villalobos Nolasco

This repository has the R code to create different simulators with RShiny.

Each simulator has one folder which has two main codes: the server.R and the ui.R; both are necessary to run a simulator.

The folder of LittleTutorialonRshiny has a pdf in which you can see how to create a shinyapp..
